# Virtua Bingo

This time we have a program written in C, which is a virtual recreation of the popular bingo game. 


The functionality will allow us to distribute bingo cards to start a game, draw each ball one by one, and check at any given moment if a specific number on the card matches our bingo. We will be able to save the game in a txt file and continue it later. If we achieve bingo, we win the game.

Working on this project takes me back to very good times at the beginning of my programming journey. Remember, strongly typed and robust code is always hard to start with but it's a great teacher. Thank you for enjoying this app!
